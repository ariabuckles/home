 * Move .dconf_profile into config/dconf/profile and change $DCONF_PROFILE
 * switch to rsync with flags for better permissions (copy perms, not owner)
    * or at least cp with the right --preserve flags
 * add fwupdmgr
 * use flatpak info --show-permissions to diff permissions before and after an update (and show on install?)
 * integrate scripts/ramdisk.sh
