 * Move .dconf_profile into config/dconf/profile and change $DCONF_PROFILE
 * switch to rsync with flags for better permissions (copy perms, not owner)
    * or at least cp with the right --preserve flags
 * add fwupdmgr
 * use flatpak info --show-permissions to diff permissions before and after an update (and show on install?)
 * integrate scripts/ramdisk.sh
 * flatpak permissions: trusted group or fuse permissions etc
 * Check for presence of aria user; if found: configure
    * usermod: shell, groups, default group
 * set up new ssh key if missing?
 * set ZDOTDIR somewhere and have zsh files in .config/zsh?
